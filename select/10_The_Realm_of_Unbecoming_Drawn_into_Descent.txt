We ended our singularity, when we walked through the door.
We've passed through the gate of
everything real and entered the realm of unbecoming.
Brittle my mind, fractured by the hurt of the world we have known.
Take me away, far from this place so we can return nevermore.
Take me away so we can disappear, into the mist.
And our souls can vanish without leaving a trace.
No one will find us and no one will try.
We will be gone, forever lost and never to be found.
