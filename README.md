[00:00.36] I lost myself into the night
[00:05.62] And I flew higher
[00:09.08] Than I had ever, but I still felt small
[00:14.23] I clipped my wings and fell from flight
[00:19.48] To open water
[00:22.91] And floated farther away from myself
[00:40.91] 
[00:28.94] And I swam in the wakes of imposters
[00:32.23] Just to feel what it's like to pretend
[00:35.72] There's no dreams in the waves, only monsters
[00:39.26] And the monsters are my only friends
[00:57.26] 
[00:43.26] They're all that I was
[00:46.75] And never could be
[00:55.75] 
[00:48.61] Eyes in the dead still water
[00:52.07] Tried but it pushed back harder
[00:56.42] Cauterized and atrophied
[00:59.59] This is my unbecoming
[01:02.53] Knives in the backs of martyrs
[01:06.02] Lives in the burning fodder
[01:10.38] Cauterized and atrophied
[01:13.49] This is my unbecoming
[01:23.99] 
[01:30.80] You found me drifted out to sea
[01:36.01] It's automatic
[01:39.52] It's telepathic, you always knew me
[01:57.02] 
[01:45.32] And you laugh as I search for a harbor
[01:48.80] As you point where your halo had been
[01:52.49] But the light in your eyes has been squandered
[01:55.96] There's no angel in you in the end
[02:12.96] 
[01:59.96] And all that I was
[02:03.24] I've left behind me
[02:12.74] 
[02:05.21] Eyes in the dead still water
[02:08.67] Tried but it pushed back harder
[02:13.01] Cauterized and atrophied
[02:16.02] This is my unbecoming
[02:18.94] Knives in the backs of martyrs
[02:22.44] Lives in the burning fodder
[02:26.92] Cauterized and atrophied
[02:29.95] This is my unbecoming
[02:40.45] 
[02:34.18] Now I wait this metamorphosis
[02:40.83] All that is left is the change
[02:44.76] Selfish fate, I think you made me this
[02:51.25] Under the water I wait
[03:02.25] 
[03:23.49] Eyes in the dead still water
[03:26.82] Tried but it pushed back harder
[03:31.26] Cauterized and atrophied
[03:34.27] This is my unbecoming
[03:37.35] Knives in the backs of martyrs
[03:40.66] Lives in the burning fodder
[03:45.00] Cauterized and atrophied
[03:48.17] This is my unbecoming
